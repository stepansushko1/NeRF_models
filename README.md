nerf-base - contains basic version of NeRF model


nerf_testing - contains improved version of NeRF. Where we tested how different improvements impact PSNR. Robust model with hierarchical sampling and distinct types of encoding
in this model we tested different approaches to sampling, modified the architecture and tested different sets of hyperparameters

nerf_model_real_data - contains tiny nerf model which was used for training on more complex scene with real data
